                <h2>The Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023: Recasting India’s Law of Evidence
                </h2>
                
                <p>The Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill, 2023 forms part of the Government of India’s ambitious effort to comprehensively modernise the country’s criminal justice framework. Alongside the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (replacing the Indian Penal Code) and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (replacing the Code of Criminal Procedure), this Bill seeks to overhaul the Indian Evidence Act, 1872—a colonial-era statute that has governed evidentiary rules for over 150 years.
                </p>
                <p>For businesses, institutions, and individuals operating in India, this reform has far-reaching implications for litigation strategy, compliance, and the adjudication of disputes.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features of the Bill</h3>
                
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h4>1. Digital Evidence at the Core
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bill explicitly recognises electronic and digital records—including emails, servers, cloud storage, SMS, instant messaging, and digital photographs—as primary evidence, giving them parity with traditional documentary evidence.
                        </li>
                        <li>This shift is critical in an era of technology-driven commerce and governance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h4>2. Streamlined Provisions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bill reduces the number of sections from 167 in the old Act to 170, consolidating and modernising archaic language.</li>
                        <li>Redundant provisions have been removed to align the law with contemporary practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h4>3. Admissibility of Electronic Records</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provisions relating to admissibility of digital evidence, earlier governed under Section 65B of the Evidence Act, are retained with greater clarity.
                        </li>
                        <li>Certificates for electronic evidence are mandatory to ensure authenticity, but the Bill aims to remove procedural uncertainty that has previously led to inconsistent judicial interpretation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h4>4. Presumptions in Law
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New presumptions have been introduced for certain categories of electronic evidence (e.g., secure electronic records and digital signatures).
                        </li>
                        <li>This is expected to reduce evidentiary disputes in both criminal and commercial proceedings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h4>5. Witness Testimony & Expert Evidence
                    </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broader scope for expert evidence, especially in forensic science and digital forensics.
                        </li>
                        <li>Virtual and video-linked testimony is recognised, facilitating efficiency in judicial proceedings.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
